# Covid-19-Detection
 Aim is to help medical practitioners helping us in battle against COVID-19 by easing the task of manual testing using Deep Learing.

    Problem type :- Supervised
    Algorithms used :- CNN
    Dataset :-  COVID X-Ray (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset); Normal X-Ray(https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
    Libraries used :- Keras, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, os
    Inspired by :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHQDDAAzIsI

Normal X-ray data can be extracted through kaggle link using OS module. Don't forget to stratify the data as it will help to get better results.
